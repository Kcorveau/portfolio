            <h1>Hello I'm Keanu</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I’m currently learning full-stack development through Codecademy, but most of my experience so far has been with Front-end development. My first interest in coding came way back when I was tinkering with my old myspace page. It was fun to see what affect altering the code did whenever I found a new profile theme. I didn’t think about coding again until I worked at for Brandlive (a Virtual Event Platform) and I was able to help play with the code for company’s registration and event pages. Since then I’ve been wanting to learn more! 
                <br><br> I’m finally taking the jump and starting my journey. In my coding journey to this point I’ve been learning HTML, CSS, and am eager to dive into my learning JavaScript. 
                <br><br> I'm a dedicated and curious learner who loves solving problems and enjoy the puzzle of taking an idea and coding it into reality.
